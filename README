Information about the following program:

=========================================
Project: CS50 The Amazing Final Project
Group: Joubertin
=========================================

---------
COMPILING
---------
There is a Makefile in the project directory.
$ make
will compile and link the necessary files to build the project.

---------
EXECUTION
---------
To execute the program, AMStartup must be run with the following three options (excluding help):

-n 	nAvatars  	-	the number of Avatars in the maze, minimum 1 and maximum AM_MAX_AVATAR (default = 10)
-d 	Difficulty 	- 	the difficulty level, on a scale of 0 (easy) to AM_MAX_DIFFICULTY (default = 9 (extremely difficult) )
-h 	Hostname	- 	the hostname of the server (i.e. pierce.cs.dartmouth.edu)
--help 			-	for usage information

Usage: ./AMStartup -n nAvatars -d Difficulty -h Hostname [--help]

nAvatars - total number of Avatars, which ranges from 1 to 10. The server will use this information to generate a maze.
Difficulty - each maze has a difficulty level that ranges from 0 (easiest) to 9 (most difficult). Given a difficulty and number of
			Avatars, the server will generate a maze.
Hostname - from where the mazes are produced and run. For the purposes of this project, the hostname "pierce.cs.dartmouth.edu" has
			been used.

Quick testing of the program can be done by running
$ ./BATS.sh
in the project directory. The testing script will test for argument checking and will carry out unit testing of the various functions of avatar, and will produce a logfile with the name
AMStartupTestlog.date
(If only unit testing is desired, testing.c can be compiled using make, and run.)

-----------
ASSUMPTIONS
-----------
Each unique combination consisting of the number of Avatars and difficulty will be used to generate a logfile in the format,
Amazing_USERNAME_nAvatars_Difficulty.log
Any pre-existing file with the same name in the project directory will be overwritten. This logfile will be produced at the end of each attempt at solving the given maze. It includes 
information about each turn of the maze-solving process, and concludes with whether or not the maze has been successfully solved. It also includes the hash generated by the server upon success. 
The avatar executable is not meant to be run by itself, and hence its arguments are not checked, necessary, and are positional; AMStartup must be run to start the entire program. For usage 
information, use the option --help
